            Flowbite is an open-source library of interactive components built on top of Tailwind CSS including buttons, dropdowns, modals, navbars, and more.

          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software so everything you see in the library has a design equivalent in our Figma file.

      question: 'What are the differences between Flowbite and Tailwind UI?',
      answer: (
        <>
          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            However, we recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
